  Version 4.
  Recent change: Made stylesheet and mimetype checks case insensitive.

  Include live.js#css to monitor css changes only.
  Include live.js#js to monitor js changes only.
  Include live.js#html to monitor html changes only.
  Mix and match to monitor a preferred combination such as live.js#html,css  

  By default, just include live.js to monitor all css, js and html changes.
  
  Live.js can also be loaded as a bookmarklet. It is best to only use it for CSS then,
  as a page reload due to a change in html or css would not re-include the bookmarklet.
  To monitor CSS and be notified that it has loaded, include it as: live.js#css,notify
